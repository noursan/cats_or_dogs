# cats_or_dogs
## CNN model for image classification
This project aims to develop a neural network model to distinguish between dogs and cats from a set of images. To that end, convolutional and pooling layers are used for feature extraction. 

Check out my project in this [python jupiter notebook](https://github.com/noursan/cats_or_dogs/blob/main/cats_or_dogs.ipynb).

The train and test data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).
